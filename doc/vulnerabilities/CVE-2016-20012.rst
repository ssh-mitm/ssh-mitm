======================================

    :bdg-warning:`CVSS 5.3`	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    ^^^
    OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a suspicion that
    a certain combination of username and public key is known to an SSH server,
    to test whether this suspicion is correct. This occurs because a challenge is
    sent only when that combination could be valid for a login session.
    +++
    **Affected Software:**

    * OpenSSH <= 8.7

    :fas:`check;sd-text-success` integrated in `SSH-MITM <https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm/blob/master/sshmitm/authentication.py>`_


Description
-----------

The only required authentication 'method name' is "publickey"
authentication.  All implementations must support this method;
however, not all users need to have public keys.

This makes it complicated to find out, if a user is allowed to login and wants to use publickey
authentication or another method like password. The reason is, because publickey authentication  comes before password authentication.

For a man in the middle server, it's important to know, which authentication method will be used by the client.
This information can be queried from the destination server.

All SSH server implementations must provide a method, which allows the client to check if a given username and publickey combination is known by the server.

The reason for implementing this method was  because private keys are often stored in an encrypted form at the client
host, and the user must supply a passphrase before the signature can be generated. To avoid unnecessary processing and user
interaction, the following message is provided for querying whether authentication using the "publickey" method would be acceptable.

.. code-block:: none
    :class: no-copybutton

    byte      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
    string    user name in ISO-10646 UTF-8 encoding [RFC3629]
    string    service name in US-ASCII
    string    "publickey"
    boolean   FALSE
    string    public key algorithm name
    string    public key blob

The server must respond to this message with either
``SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE`` or with the following:

.. code-block:: none
    :class: no-copybutton

    byte      SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK
    string    public key algorithm name from the request
    string    public key blob from the request


.. mermaid::

    graph TD
        A[SSH Client] -->|send publickey| B(OpenSSH)
        B --> C{<b>username</b><br> and<br> <b>publickey</b><br>known?}
        C -->|yes| D[send<br><b>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK</b>]
        C -->|no| E[send<br><b>SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE</b>]

.. note::

    According to RFC-4252 the client is not required to complete the authentication process.

If the client receives a ``SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PK_OK`` message, the username/publickey combination is known by the server.
When a ``SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_FAILURE`` the client can send a new username/publickey combination to the server.

If no valid combination was found and no publickeys are left, the user is not allowed to login with publickey authentication.

This allowed a man in the middle server to check, if the intercepted user is allowed to login with publickey authentication or not.

Test with SSH-MITM
------------------

SSH-MITM's authetication process implements this method to check if the intercepted user is allowed to login wiht publickey
authentication on the remote server.

There is also a standalone check available, which allows during an audit to check a username/publickey combination against a server.

.. code-block:: none

    $ ssh-mitm audit check-publickey --host 127.0.0.1 \
        --username testuser \
        --public-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    valid key
